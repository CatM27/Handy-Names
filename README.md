# Handy-Names
A handy way to spell your name

Handy Names is a webpage entry to a Code First:Girls course competition by Catriona, Sara and Marusa. In just over 15 hours we learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, had a lot of pizza and we introduced to tools such as GitHub and Atom. 
In order to showcase the amazing skills we picked up and teach the world about British Sign Language, we put together Handy Names!
